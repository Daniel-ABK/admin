# 22nd of July 2018 Meeting Notes
## Three new members!
*	Luke, Lachlan and Jin. Welcome to you all!
*	Very interested in working with us :) . 
##	Dinner august 22nd after WanChain conference.
*	WanChain will cover the event. Event is free for attendees!
*	Will be hosted at the new MoonshineLabs location. Hopefully will be large enough!
*	Try to promote and expose this event, we want maximum attendance.
##	Constitution 
*	Write down roles.
*	New issue will be raised on GitHub – EVERYONE needs to read the constitution, this should be done by next Sunday (29th).
*	Raise any issues or concerns through GitHub.
*	Ivan is converting the constitution to MarkDown form. 
*	We want to incorporate within the next coming two weeks.
##	Roles on constitution
*	Added the ‘Executive Advisor’ role (up to five people).  
####	We can’t have people like Rusty in this position as this would mean that they would need to be present for all meetings (which will never happen).
####	We can have them as general members instead which gives them and us freedom. Externally we say that they are advisors but are not part of the committee.   
*	Doubled ‘Head of Education’ and ‘Events Coordinator’ roles.

*	Will help promote activity and participation within our sphere.
##	Event management

*	Doesn’t seem fair to force the role upon the newer guys, especially due to the responsibility it carries. 
##	We can hold lectures at Adelaide no problem
*	Is this something we want to do though? 
##	Paul’s Mentor, Mr Shahin
*	Came off as positive and very interested in helping us out, particularly with reaching out and connecting with the government.
