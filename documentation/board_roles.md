# Adelaide Blockchain Board Roles

As the Head of various departments in Adelaide Blockchain, it's important to note that each department will constitute multiple individuals completing deliverables. Head of departments are responsible for the progression of work but aren't required to do all or most of the work. The hope is that we get a diverse range of individuals on the Board with different skillsets, opinions and ways of thinking to ensure the organisation can run in a manner that best suits the initiative. I do understand that some of you have time constraints/availability issues with all your commitments, so I hope if there is a fit, Adelaide Blockchain would be able to accommodate. 

In general, the work in the organisation will be a collaborative effort, and as such people can help in any way they wish. From the list of Directors, a President, Treasurer and a Secretary will be picked. 
In situations where there are multiple people equally qualified and/or eager for a particular position, co-head of departments is also an option.
