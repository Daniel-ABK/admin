# Adelaide Blockchain Team Member Roles

### Blockchain developer/educator 5-10 people

Blockchain developers and educators at Adelaide Blockchain will be apart of the core R&D team.

Lead by Daniel Ng and Ivan Seara Nunes, developers will learn to code Blockchain related technologies and be part of various Blockchain projects hosted by Adelaide Blockchain that will be released in the coming weeks (announced soon) for people to work on! The developer team will be also be required to develop code and implement all software required for the maintenance and expansion of Adelaide Blockchain initiatives as it continues to grow. 

The internal developer team will also have access to our Global Blockchain network and will have the opportunity to work with various stakeholders not only in the state (there are many projects popping up, but not enough developers!), but nationally and internationally. The people who show the most ambition and talent are the ones that that will be able to capitalize on opportunity!

Expected hours: 3-10 hours per week. 

### Marketing Officer 1-2 People

Marketing officers are required to work with the Co-Head's of Marketing, Ruslan Mugalimov and Sarah Jamieson, in order to consistently send out great content and marketing material about various topics in the Blockchain industry, exposure to our audience of the initiatives taking place at Adelaide Blockchain and the various events that we run. 

It will be expected over time for the Marketing team to constantly build out new creative ways of engaging with our audiences and strategizing how to develop new ones!

We have a highly ambitious set of goals and roadmap to suit, so we will also expect our Marketing Officers to be just as ambitious!

Expected hours: 2-5 hours per week.

### Operations Officer

Assisting our President and Head of Operations, Paul Pounendis, you will be required to help with the delegated day to day operations of the Association. This includes general administration, hiring, conflict resolution and general communication between departments. 

Expected hours: 3-6 hours a week. 

### General Committee. 

We run many events during the year, and we need help running them! General Committee members will be required to work with the Operations and Marketing team to perform all logistical requirements of such events. A more intermittent role, some weeks may require no input while others a lot!

We will be running an event in the coming weeks bringing together everyone who has successfully applied for positions, giving the opportunity for the team to meet our potential new members before we formalise positions.
