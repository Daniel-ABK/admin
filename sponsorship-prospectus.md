About us
=======
Adelaide Blockchain is a student run multi-university and interdisciplinary Blockchain organisation based in Adelaide, Australia. Our organisation is dedicated to create awareness, engage and educate students and the wider community about Blockchain technology.
We collectively believe that Blockchain and other Web 3.0 technologies will fundamentally disrupt many aspects of the global economy. By encouraging education and collaboration in both a practical and theoretical sense we can facilitate the movement towards a distributed economy.

We wish to work with local, national and global Blockchain initiatives to benefit from your experience, knowledge and sponsorship to truly develop our vision. By running meetups, workshops, boot camps, hackathons, industry panels’ discussions and more, we believe our university organisation has a unique opportunity to engage local talent networks and facilitate collaboration to work seamlessly within the broader global blockchain community. 

Events
=======
Adelaide Blockchain seeks to integrate the community through 3 main channels: workshops and courses, meetups, bootcamps and hackathons.

### 1. Workshops and courses ###

We aim to cater to wide range of knowledge and skills. With that perspective, our workshops and courses are our key priority to equip individuals with a minimum viable skillset to interface with the industry. We envision creating two 6-part series courses, described below, about Blockchain technology starting August 2018 to achieve this goal. 

#### 1.A Code development ####
This course will be based on familiarising with basic Blockchain concepts, fundamentals and code libraries. Topics discussed will also include; in depth education on Ethereum nomenclature, smart contracts, security, token standards, virtual machine, and other topics that include the Lightning network and scalability.

#### 1.B Blockchain theory ####
This course will be geared towards those without a technological background.  Topics discussed will explore Blockchain’s inherent strengths and weaknesses, token economics and incentivization, practical use cases and an introduction to Blockchain start-up marketing and business strategy, and ICOs.
Workshops will complement the lecture series to enable a more hands on and collaborative approach.

### 2. Meetups ###

We believe monthly meetups are the best way our organisation engages general interest about Blockchain technology in the Adelaide community. During our meetup events we present on recent trending news in the space and bring knowledgeable people to guide discussion that benefits everyone. Additionally, we use our discord group to gauge key interest areas and member queries in between meetups that may be good discussion points during events. This approach seeks to encourage enduring conversation. 

### 3. Bootcamps and Hackathons ###

To further foster Adelaide Blockchain’s community, especially students, we plan to run Blockathons (Blockchain + Hackathon) and bootcamps, incorporating talent from diverse fields to come together, collaborate and strategize solutions to identified issues. We hope this will create an ecosystem that will bootstrap individuals with the ethos of distributed contribution. 

Budget
=======
We have created a tiered outline for our budget; the structure prioritises expenditure to ensure the minimum cost for running organisation is accounted for. 

Tier 1 outlines the proposed costs to sustain our organisation. Tier 2 & 3 are aspirational goals that we believe will assist in facilitating our vision within the global Blockchain community. We understand as a new organisation that establishing our fundamental organisation is a priority, however, all additional funding in the Tier 2 and 3 sectors will only add value to our community. 

Tier 2 & 3 funds will aim to fund influencers and industry professionals to come and share their knowledge, and also endeavour to send our most talented committee members to key international Blockchain conferences.
